# Workflow Run ROC

The problematic part of scientific recording is the provenance of its outputs. 

#### ROCrate

Packages research data with metadata from platform

#### Workflow Run ROC

Represents computational workflow execution provenance (both prospective and retrospective). 

IMP: look at SKOS and AUTOSUBMIT

3 profiles: 
- Process Run Crate: execution of one or more tools
- Workflow Run Crate: execution of predefined workflow
- Provenance Run Crate: collects internal details of each step

Problem: during development, developers don't like to handle wfs. But that's where the important provenace is collected.
