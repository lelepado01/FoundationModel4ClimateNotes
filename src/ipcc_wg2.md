## B: Observed and Projected Impacts and Risks

Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. 
Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions driven by patterns of intersecting socioeconomic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance. 

Current unsustainable development patterns are increasing exposure of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. 

### Risks in the near term (2021–2040)
Global warming, reaching 1.5°C in the near-term, would cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards and present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. 

### Mid to Long-term Risks (2041–2100)
Beyond 2040 and depending on the level of global warming, climate change will lead to numerous risks to natural and human systems. 
The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming
