### Ideas

Agile approach to research, with many small projects (POC), check up every 3-6 months, which can be integrated into larger projects. All with a general topic, one of the following:

 - [ ] Ensamble of models which output the certainty of their prediction, instead of the prediction
 - [ ] Tool for long range prediction (years) with CMIP data
 - [ ] Tool for socio-economic decision making with climate data (IPCC report)
    - Multi-modal forecaster using both climate and socio-economic data (ex. average income...)
 - [ ] Graph compression with GNNs, which can be used for data elaboration
 - [ ] Wildfire prediction/forecasting (with geo)
    - Drought prediction/forecasting (with geo) 
    - add wind data and see expansion
    - add temperature data and see expansion 
    - terrain type (forest, grassland, desert, crops, etc.)
      - could help type of crop decisions

 - [ ] Flood prediction/forecasting (with geo)
    - Landslide prediction/forecasting (with geo)
    - type of terrain (rock, sand, etc.)
    - faglie
 - [ ] Earthquake prediction/forecasting (with geo)
    - Tsunami prediction/forecasting (with geo)
    - Volcano prediction/forecasting (with geo)
