### TODOs

- [ ] Paper: The rise of data driven weather forecasts
- [ ] Look at foundation models scaling laws
- [ ] Is it possible to finetune for prediction of unseen variables?
- [ ] Look into surrogate models, which can be intergrated into larger projects together
- [ ] Project: AI CCA cloud classification atlas 
- [ ] Look into Temporal GNNs
- [ ] Look into GNNs for climate
- [ ] Look at Neural GCM @ google
- [ ] Look at Neural General Circulation Models
- [x] Look at Liquid neural networks
- [ ] Look at Recurrent Fast Weight Programmers
