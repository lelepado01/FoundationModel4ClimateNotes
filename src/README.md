# Introduction

### Resources

> [Summary](https://github.com/shengchaochen82/Awesome-Foundation-Models-for-Weather-and-Climate)

### Ideas

Agile approach to research, with many small projects (POC), check up every 3-6 months, which can be integrated into larger projects. All with a general topic, one of the following:

 - [ ] Ensamble of models which output the certainty of their prediction, instead of the prediction
 - [ ] Tool for long range prediction (years) with CMIP data
 - [ ] Tool for socio-economic decision making with climate data (IPCC report)
    - Multi-modal forecaster using both climate and socio-economic data (ex. average income...)
 - [ ] Graph compression with GNNs, which can be used for data elaboration

### Useful Datasets

- World Input-Output Database (WIOD)
- Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)
- World Bank Open Data
- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
- Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
- Internal monetary fund (IMF)

### TODOs

- [ ] Paper: The rise of data driven weather forecasts
- [ ] Look at foundation models scaling laws
- [ ] Is it possible to finetune for prediction of unseen variables?
- [ ] Look into surrogate models, which can be intergrated into larger projects together
- [ ] Project: AI CCA cloud classification atlas 
- [ ] Look into Temporal GNNs
- [x] Look into GNNs for climate
- [x] Look at Neural GCM @ google
- [x] Look at Neural General Circulation Models
- [x] Look at Liquid neural networks
- [x] Look at Recurrent Fast Weight Programmers
