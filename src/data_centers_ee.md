# Data centers energy efficiency

For power and energy efficiency

Holistic power management: 
- Resource provisioning and stranded power (this includes power and cooling, it's around 50% of all power). 
- Reduce perfoemance but but increase energy efficiency. 
- Increase / reduce speed selectively at runtime (not before the scheduling). It automatically estimates the type of compute/memory bound process. 
- Performance to sustainability slider.
