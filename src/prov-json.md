# Interoperability with PROV-JSON for Provenance aware databases

## Introduction

The PROV standard has been widely adopted as a standardized exchange format for provenance information. 
However, adaptation for provenance aware databases is still lacking. 
Here operations of import, export, query and visualization of provenance information are discussed for graph databases (GProM). 

With PROV it is possible to track the provenance of an entity during its entire lifecycle.
