# LSTM Vis

Understand RNN through visualization.
Three types of users: 
- Architect: new deep learning methodologies
- Trainers: apply architectures to domain
- End users: use general purpose pretrained models (XAI)

Use cases: 
- Generate an hypothesis about properties of hidden states
- Refine hypothesis
- Compare models and datasets
- Visualize hidden states / filter hidden states
- Match selections to similar examples
- Align textual annotations + interface

This tool also gives per-token insight into the hidden states of the model.
