# ChatGPT for Global Warming

Climate change requires inter-disciplinary appproach with several topics (atm. science, oceanography, biology, etc.). 
ChatGPT could help with: 
 - Data analysis and interpretation
 - Communication of complex information wo wide audience
 - Decision making and recommendations
 - Climate scenario generation, with alternative inputs

Limitations: 
 - Understanding complex concepts (scientific background, may not understand scientific correlations)
 - Lack of contextual awareness
 - Biases from training data
 - Accountability for decision and output (ethical problems)
 - Limited scope of expertise (up to date knowledge problem)

TODO: CAN WE TRAIN IT ON DAILY INFORMATION, TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE?

# Machine Learning for Climate Change Research

Climate change research will require high adaptability to understand better the complete climate system. 

Problem of uncertainty: more data in some instances could be useful. 

Dimensionality reduction: differential equation govern how ESM behave --> complex
There are three main approaches: 
 - non-dimensionalization of equation term: create reduced set of linked equations
 - dimensional analysis: both collapse the complexity and relate different strands of data (linkage can aid reconstruction, parametrization or testing)
 - statistical techniques: using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to reduce the dimensionality of the data
 - emergent constraints (EC): refine projections by searching across ESM ensembles for regression between modelled climate systems

How to integrate ML with these reduction techniques?

## Machine Learning applications in climate

- Extreme events forecasting
- Uncertainty in climate response
- Build ecological-climate equations (interactions)
    The key interaction equations are known
    - Ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and decomposition
    - Operate at individual tree level
    - Unknown are the equations that capture complex canopy structure and temperature-dependant variations in leaf processing. It can cause uncertainty in global carbon fluxes.
