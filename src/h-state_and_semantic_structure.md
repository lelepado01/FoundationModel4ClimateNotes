# Relationship between H-state and Semantic Structure

Research questions: 
- Are the hidden states linearly separable?

To gain insights into the structure of hidden states (linear separability is a requirement for clustering)

- Is the clustering hypothesis valid?

Definition of a cluster and usefulness of a cluster, Do hidden state cluster correlate with DFA? 

Results shown are "often linearly separable", not quantifiable. 

Also very formal language paper (not quantifiable).
