# Incremental Models

## Literature Review

## RNNs Shortcomings

- Are not guided in the compression process of information (there is probably a better way for them to learn important tokens). 
- How do we learn the important tokens? We understand the context. 

Or maybe we just base importance on the length of the token. How do we know the importance of a token if we encode it in a fixed size vector? 
Size dependant encoding?

IMP: this doesn't work with images.
