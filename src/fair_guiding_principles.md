# FAIR Guiding Principles

## Introduction 

The FAIR guiding principles are data principles for guidelines to enhance the reusability of code and data. 

How to obtain good data management?  

Guide the data producers as they navigate the flow of data from the point of creation to the point of publication. To maximize added value√¨, all components must be available, and gurantee reproducibility and transparency. 

## Principles

- Findability: to be foundable, data must have a global unique identifier, have rich metadata, and be registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

- Accessibility: data must be retrievable by their identifier using a standard protocol, and the metadata must be accessible even when the data is no longer available. The protocol must be open, free, and universally implementable, and allow for authentication if the process needs it to.

- Interoperability: data must be able to be integrated with other data, and be able to be used by a variety of applications. Data must include qualified access to other metadata, as well as to follow FAIR principles. 

- Reusability: data must be well-described, and have a rich metadata. It must be described with a plurality of different relevant attributes, have clear and accessible licence, detailed provenance, and meet domain-relevant community standards.

All principles are implementation agnostic, and can be applied to any domain.
