# Research Methodoloogies Course

**Research**: 
- Originality: do not reuse results from others; 
- Systematic: 
    - Rigorous: if you really have to, use others work in a precise way;
    - Significant: contribute to knowledge;

### Originality

This includes new findings / theorems / laws, new ways of thinking (survey papers), new ways of achieving facts / doing things. 

### Rigoorous

Integrity, robustness, reproducibility, transparency and precision. Experiments are conducted in a precise way (ex. data collection).

## Research Paradigms

- Formal research: theories, models, proofs
- analytical research: direct / indirect observation
- constructive research: new processes and products

Method: set of principles, rules, and procedures which can guide a person to something
- Does the scientific method exist?
- Are results truth? 
- Does the truth hold only in a certain context?
- Is it valid only under certain conditions? Or with a certain level of confidence?

A proof is truth until you manage to disprove it. (confirm is different from prove)
One sample is enough to invalidate a theory.

Validation through experimentation, so proof by counter-example

## Experimental Method

- Inductive step: build theory (hypothesis and thesis (generalization))
- Deductive step: challenge the theory to give it strength

- Refutation: disproof (could be useful for improvement of the theory)
- Theory inference: thesis are expressed with levels of certainty (ex. 95% confidence)

- Sound theory: if whatever it infers is true (does not explain false negatives)
- Complete theory: if all truths can be inferred / explained (but also non-true facts)

We ideally want a theory to be sound and complete.

Truths can be: 
- Quantitative: explain with a certain probability the truth
- Qualitative: explain the truth in a binary way

Case study:
- Observational: novel approaches
- Feasibility: if solution has potential
- Comparative: compare different approaches
- Community: benchmarking
- Replicability: same experiments but different settings

## Product of Research

Either enriches the knowledge or usable to further enhance practice. Needs to be usable and diffusable. Results need to be: original (novel), rigorous (mathematical / experimental), significant (have impact / influence). 

Publication:
- Incremental work (revisions and refinements)
- Direct diffusion or diffusion after peer review
- Clarification of what you have done

Diffusion techniques:
- Conferences: lower acceptance rate, faster diffusion (easier to publish), have more predictability  (fixed submission dates)
- Journals: higher acceptance rate, slower diffusion (harder to publish), have less predictability (rolling submission), more feedback than conferences

Different research communities have different diffusion techniques and habits.

## Research Conduct

Research integrity is adherence to ethics principles (open, plagiarism, honest, fair). 

Misconduct:
- Fabrication: making up data
- Falsification: manipulating data and research material
- Plagiarism: using others work without proper citation
- Overselling: overestimating the results (making them look better)

Material sent to reviewers is confidential (also do not share label).

- Double blind: anonymity of authors and reviewers
- Single blind: anonymity of reviewers
- No blind: no anonymity (favours taking responsibility)
