> [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03014.pdf)

## Difficulties

- Post-processing of data
    - Costs for specific scenarios and analysis (ex. outliers in rare events)
    - Under-utilization of existing data since it is expensive to process
- Data quality and quantity

## Opportunities

- Multimodal models: radar, satellite, numerical weather prediction, etc.
- Interpretable models / explainable AI / causal AI
- Generizable models
    - can the model predict out of scope?
    - can the model avoid bias and flaws in the training data?
- Continuous learning: can the model learn from new data?
- On-device adaptation: customize a model based on local data (ex. adjust to local climate)
- Federated Learning: each company trains their own model, but they can share their models to improve the overall model. Global model learns from updates from local models.
