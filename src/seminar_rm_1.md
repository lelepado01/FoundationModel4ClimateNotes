# Seminar Research Methodologies 1 (Research Output and Publication)

In computer science, conference proceedings make up 60% of the research output. 
Old conferences are better, as more interactive in counseling. 

Papers can be retracted (un-published) if they are found to be fraudulent.

> WikiCFP (to find conferences)

Time of submission to conferences is usually 6-9 months before the conference date. And 3-6 months to write the first draft of the paper. 
To understand where to publish, check where similar papers got published (conferences), so you know where they could be accepted. 

## Books

Complete scholarly topic on one subject. Collection of papers (re-elaborated). 

Impact of your publication: how to select? 
- Impact factor: number of citations for articles in prev. 2 years divided by the number of articles published in the same period.

Why only in two years? Because it is the time frame in medicine where research tends to lose its relevance. In CS, after 10 years, it is estimated that the paper would have received half of its citations (so it will receive less impact factor).
Impact factor is discipline dependant. 

Other metrics: 
- Scopus: number of citations
- H-index: number of papers with at least h citations.
