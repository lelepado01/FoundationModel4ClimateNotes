# Initial Notes

The reades expects to find some features in the document (conventions). 

Principles:
 - Identify words that express actions for each sentence. 
 - Transform nominalizations into verbs (actions). The reader expects the focus of action to be expressed by the verb. 
 - Pay attention to important characters. 

### Characters

 - Character has to be the subject of the verb 

Subject + verb + object

or

Character + Action

 - Move characters with the passive voice: readers read sentence keeping most regard for the thing that comes first (so adjust character). Contextualizing information is used at the beginning where it is needed. Also control the action you really want to express.


### Separation

No interruptions between subject and verb, and verb and complement. 
Qualifying material can be used as interruptions sparsely. 

 - Move verb closer to subject.
 - Place information between commas is considered less important by the reader.
 - No very large thematic jumps. 

Beginning of a sentence: 
 - Active or passive voice.
 - Multi-clause sentences: pay attention to the main clause, this is what the reader thinks the sentence is about.
 - Backward links: connections to previous sentences.
 - Themes: everything up to the verb.
    - Repeated: each sentence is about the same thing.
    - Link: each sentence links back to the previous one through qualifying material. 
    - Super: the first sentence contains the information for all subsequent sentences.
    - Preview: summarizes the subsequent sentences in the first one. 

### Stress Position

Ending of sentence:
 - can be formed by 2 or more elements.
 - it delivers closure to the sentence.
