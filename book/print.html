<p>It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.</p>
<p>Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr‚Äì1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr‚Äì1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr‚Äì1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ar6_1.png" alt="WG1_1" /></p>
<p>Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. </p>
<p>Improved knowledge of climate processes, paleoclimate evidence and the response of the climate system to increasing radiative forcing gives a best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3¬∞C. </p>
<h2 id="possible-climate-futures"><a class="header" href="#possible-climate-futures">Possible Climate Futures</a></h2>
<p>Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5¬∞C and 2¬∞C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades.</p>
<p>Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and, in some regions, agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the proportion of intense tropical cyclones; and reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost. </p>
<p>It is virtually certain that the land surface will continue to warm more than the ocean surface. It is virtually certain that the Arctic will continue to warm more than global surface temperature, with high confidence above two times the rate of global warming.</p>
<p>Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry events. Also, under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the ocean and land carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/wg1_2.png" alt="WG1_2" /></p>

<p>Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. 
Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions driven by patterns of intersecting socioeconomic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance. </p>

<p>Total net anthropogenic GHG emissions6 have continued to rise during the period 2010‚Äì2019, as have cumulative net CO2 emissions since 1850. 
Regional contributions to global GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Variations in regional, and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global household GHG emissions. At least 18 countries have sustained GHG emission reductions for longer than 10 years. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ipcc_wg3_1.png" alt="Figure 1.1" /></p>
<p>Globally, the 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34‚Äì45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions,21 while the middle 40% contribute 40‚Äì53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13‚Äì15%.</p>
<p>The unit costs of several low-emission technologies have fallen continuously since 2010. Innovation policy packages have enabled these cost reductions and supported global adoption. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ipcc_wg3_2.png" alt="Figure 1.2" /></p>
<p>There has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation since AR5. This has led to the avoidance of emissions that would otherwise have occurred and increased investment in low-GHG technologies and infrastructure. Policy coverage of emissions is uneven across sectors.</p>
<p>Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) announced prior to COP2623 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5¬∞C during the 21st century.24 Likely limiting warming to below 2¬∞C would then rely on a rapid acceleration of mitigation efforts after 2030.</p>
<h2 id="system-transformations-to-limit-global-warming"><a class="header" href="#system-transformations-to-limit-global-warming">System Transformations to Limit Global Warming</a></h2>
<p>Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5¬∞C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2¬∞C (&gt;67%) and assume immediate action. 
Without a strengthening of policies beyond those that are implemented by the end of 2020, GHG emissions are projected to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2¬∞C by 2100. </p>
<p>All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5¬∞C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot, and those that limit warming to 2¬∞C (&gt;67%), involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emission reductions in all sectors. </p>
<p>This would involve very low or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 emissions, and deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods to counterbalance residual GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions across the full energy sector requires major transitions, including a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, the deployment of low-emission energy sources, switching to alternative energy carriers, and energy efficiency and conservation. </p>
<p>Net zero CO2 emissions from the industrial sector are challenging but possible. Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes.</p>
<p>Urban areas can create opportunities to increase resource efficiency and significantly reduce GHG emissions through the systemic transition of infrastructure and urban form through low-emission development pathways towards net-zero emissions. </p>
<p>In modelled global scenarios, existing buildings, if retrofitted, and buildings yet to be built, are projected to approach net zero GHG emissions in 2050 if policy packages, which combine ambitious sufficiency, efficiency, and renewable energy measures, are effectively implemented and barriers to decarbonisation are removed.</p>
<p>The deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions is unavoidable if net zero CO2 or GHG emissions are to be achieved. The scale and timing of deployment will depend on the trajectories of gross emission reductions in different sectors. </p>
<p>Mitigation options costing USD100 tCO2-eq‚Äì1 or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030. </p>

<h2 id="current-status-and-trends"><a class="header" href="#current-status-and-trends">Current Status and Trends</a></h2>
<p>Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1¬∞C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. 
The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850‚Äì1900 to 2010‚Äì20197 is 0.8¬∞C to 1.3¬∞C, with a best estimate of 1.07¬∞C. </p>
<p>Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected. </p>
<p>Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards.</p>

<p>Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals. 
In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity. The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases and the incidence of vector-borne diseases have increased. In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are associated with increasing temperatures. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ar6_1.png" alt="AR6_1" /></p>
<p>Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions, with documented benefits and varying effectiveness. Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. </p>
<p>Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes. 
Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and vulnerable groups adversely. 
Key barriers to adaptation are limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilization of finance (including for research), low climate literacy, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation science, and low sense of urgency. </p>
<p>Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded since AR5. Global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October 2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5¬∞C during the 21st century and make it harder to limit warming below 2¬∞C. 
There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate goals across all sectors and regions. </p>

<p>Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5¬∞C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards. </p>
<p>Global warming will continue to increase in the near term (2021‚Äì2040) mainly due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5¬∞C even under the very low GHG emission scenario and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5¬∞C under higher emissions scenarios. </p>
<p>With further warming, every region is projected to increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers. Compound heatwaves and droughts are projected to become more frequent, including concurrent events across multiple locations. Projected regional changes include intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and increases in aridity and fire weather. </p>
<p>With every increment of global warming, regional changes in mean climate and extremes become more widespread and pronounced. Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming. 
The level of risk will also depend on trends in vulnerability and exposure of humans and ecosystems. Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including migration, growing inequality and urbanisation. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ar6_2.png" alt="Ar6_2" /></p>
<p>Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be limited by deep, rapid, and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The likelihood of abrupt and/or irreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. 
Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise acceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment.</p>

<p>As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests, coral reefs, and in Arctic regions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and less effective with increasing global warming. With increasing global warming, losses and damages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. </p>
<p>Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon emissions until the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 1.5¬∞C or 2¬∞C. All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5¬∞C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot, and those that limit warming to 2¬∞C (&gt;67%), involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/ar6_3.png" alt="AR63" /></p>
<p>If warming exceeds a specified level such as 1.5¬∞C, it could gradually be reduced again by achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions. This would require additional deployment of carbon dioxide removal, compared to pathways without overshoot, leading to greater feasibility and sustainability concerns. Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems, all growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. </p>

increased international cooperation including improved access to adequate financial resources, particularly for vulnerable regions, sectors and groups, and inclusive governance and coordinated policies. </p>
<p>Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems. Delayed mitigation and adaptation action would lock in high-emissions infrastructure, raise risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation, reduce feasibility, and increase losses and damages. Near-term actions involve high up-front investments and potentially disruptive changes that can be lessened by a range of enabling policies. </p>
<p>These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions. </p>
<p>Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, inclusion and just transition processes can enable adaptation and ambitious mitigation actions and climate resilient development. Adaptation outcomes are enhanced by increased support to regions and people with the highest vulnerability to climatic hazards. </p>

<p>A graph is a kind of data structure, which is composed of nodes (objects) and edges (relationships).</p>
<p>Most of the current GNNs are based on the message passing paradigm, which is a generalization of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean domains.</p>
<p>Often GNNs suffer from the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-smoothing</strong>: the information from the nodes is averaged out, and the model cannot distinguish between nodes that are far away from each other.</li>
<li><strong>Over-squashing</strong>: due to the exponential computation with the increase in model depth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-of-gnns-in-transformers"><a class="header" href="#use-of-gnns-in-transformers">Use of GNNs in Transformers</a></h2>
<p>There have been developed three main ways to use GNNs in Transformers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auxiliary Modules: GNNs are used to inject auxiliary information to improve the performance of the Transformer.</li>
<li>Improve Positional Embedding with Graph: compress the graph structure into positional embedding vectors, and input them to the Vanilla Transformer.</li>
<li>Improve attention matrix from graph: inject graph priors into the attention computation via graph bias terms. </li>
</ul>
<p>These type of modifications tend to yield improved performance both on node level and graph leevel tasks, more efficient training and inference, and better generalization. This being said different group models enjoy different benefits.</p>
<p>Graph building blocks can be used on top of existing attention mechanisms, can be alternated with self-attention layers, or can be used in conjunction (concatenated) with existing transformer blocks. </p>
<h2 id="some-architectures"><a class="header" href="#some-architectures">Some Architectures</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>GraphTrans</strong>: adds a transformer sub-networkon top of a standard GNN layer. It performs as a specialized architecture to learn local representation, while the transformer sub-network learns global representation of pairwise node interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Grover</strong>: uses two GTransformers to learn node and edge representations, respectively. The node representations are then used to update the edge representations, and vice versa. The inputs are first passed to a GNN which is trained to extract vectors as query, key and value. This layer is then followed by a self-attention layer.</li>
<li><strong>GraphiT</strong>: adopts a Graph Convolutional Kernel Network layer to produce a stucture aware embedding of the graph. The output of this layer is then passed to a self-attention layer.</li>
<li><strong>Mesh Graphormer</strong>: stacks Graph residual blocks on a multi-head self-attention layer. The graph residual block is composed of a graph attention layer and a graph feed-forward layer. It improves the local interactions using a graph convolutional layer in each transformer block.</li>
<li><strong>GraphBERT</strong>: uses graph residual terms in each attention layer. It concatenates the graph residual terms with the original attention matrix, and then applies a linear transformation to the concatenated matrix.</li>

<p>How to rout information in a sequence of tokens? -&gt; We use query + key matrices</p>

<p>Inner product is used to rout (similarity between query and key). 
This is called <em>soft-routing</em> as it is a weighted average of all the keys (where inner product is larger).</p>

<p>\( Q \times K = n \times n \) -&gt; where multi-head attention doesn't help, but the n matrix could be simplified into n/heads matrix.</p>
<p>Ex. 4 heads -&gt; 512 / 4 = 128</p>
<p>We can approximate Q into a low rank matrix, and complexity would be reduced to \( O(n) \). </p>
<h2 id="linear-transformer"><a class="header" href="#linear-transformer">Linear Transformer</a></h2>
<p>\( \text{Attention} = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V \)</p>
<p>If the term inside the softmax is low rank, then we can reduce computation. </p>
<p>Eigenvalues of Q and K can be used to determine if matrix needs to be high or low rank.

<p>How to reduce dimensionality?
We can use a random projection P before the self-attention layer. </p>
<p>\( \text{Attention} = \text{softmax}(\frac{Q(EK)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})FV \)</p>
<p>So we introduce the E and F matrices (fixed, not learned). The term inside the softmax becomes nxk, while FV is kxn. 
The shapes so are correct for matmult. </p>
<h2 id="results"><a class="header" href="#results">Results</a></h2>
<p>With large sequence lengths, the linear transformer keeps inference times <strong>constant</strong>, as it doesn't depend on the sequence length n but also on k.
Complexity is reduced from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(nk) \).</p>
<p>How to choose k?</p>
<p>\( k = \frac{5\log(n)}{c} \)</p>
<p>So it depends on n still? Complexity is \( O(n\log(n)) \) now.</p>
<p>However we can make it linear:</p>
<p>\( k = min { \theta(9d \log(d)), 5\theta(\log(n)) } \)</p>
<p>In the first case it is linear in d, in the second case it is linear in n.
We can choose the minimum of the two. So it's enough to downproject the matrix to a dimension of about d. </p>

<p>These are <strong>continuous time models</strong> (CTMs), which also allow for irregular sampling. </p>
<p>State Space Models (SSM) are parameterized by matrices A, B, C, D, and map an input signal \( u(t) \) to
output \( y(t) \)  through a latent state \( x(t) \). Recent theory on continuous-time memorization derives special A matrices that allow SSMs to capture LRDs mathematically and empirically. (Right) SSMs can be computed
either as a recurrence or convolution.</p>
<p>Drawbacks are that are inefficient and prone to vanishing gradients. 
S4 introduces a novel parameterization that efficiently swaps between these representations, allowing it to handle a wide range of tasks, be efficient at both training and inference, and excel at long sequences.</p>
<p>Combine strength of the former models into State space models (SSMs): </p>
<ul>
<li>Seq to seq: discretization of continuous sequence</li>
<li>RNN: hidden memory state</li>
<li>CNN: efficient computation and parallelization ability</li>

<p>\( u(t) \leftarrow y(y) \)</p>
<p>where \( u(t) \) is the input and \( y(t) \) is the output. </p>
<p>\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \)
\( y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \)</p>
<p>where \( x(t) \) is the hidden state space, \( u(t) \) is the input, \( y(t) \) is the output we are trying to predict, \( A \) is the most important matrix called state matrix. 
\( x(t) \) can be a continuous function or a discrete sequence obtained by sampling.</p>
<p>How do we initialize the state matrix so that it handles long term dependencies?</p>
<p>(these matrices are not learned)</p>
<p>The Hippo approach allows memorization of the input (input reconstruction), even after a long time. It works by encoding the data with Legendre polynomials, which are orthogonal and can be computed efficiently. 
It allows to fully describe the input sequence even after long sequences. </p>
<p>The idea is to condition A with low rank correction (computable as Cauchy kernel). 
A can be computed with the Hippo method, continuous time memorization (set of useful matrices).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To discretize: sample from the continuous function \( x(t) \) at discrete time points \( t_i \)
Convert A to discrete time matrix \( \hat{A} \) using the formula: 
\( \hat{A} = (I - \frac{\delta}{2}A)^{-1} (I + \frac{\delta}{2}A) \)</p>

<p>ClimaX is a foundation model designed to be pre-trained on heterogeneous data sources and then
fine-tuned to solve various downstream weather and climate problems. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/climax1.png" alt="ClimaX Architecture" /></p>
<p>The set of climate and weather
variables is extremely broad, and predictions may be required for regional or even spatially incomplete
data, even at different resolutions. Current CNN-based architectures are not applicable in these
scenarios, as they require the input to be perfectly gridded, contain a fixed set of variables, and have
a fixed spatial resolution. resolution. Transformer-based architectures, on the other hand, offer much
greater flexibility by treating the image-like data as a set of tokens. As a consequence, the backbone
architecture chosen is a <strong>Vision Transformer</strong> to provide greater flexibility. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/climax2.png" alt="ClimaX Architecture" /></p>
<p>Two significant changes to this model were implemented. The first change involved variable
tokenization, which includes separating each variable into its own channel and tokenizing the input
into a sequence of patches. The second change was variable aggregation, introduced to speed up
computation by reducing the dimensionality of the input data and to aid in distinguishing between
different variables, thereby enhancing attention-based training.
After combining variables, the vision transformer block can produce output tokens that are then
processed through a linear prediction head to recreate the original image. During the pre-training
phase, a latitude-weighted reconstruction error is used to keep into account the location of the current
patch. For fine-tuning, the ClimaX modules can be frozen, allowing for training only on the intended
part of the architecture. In fact, often only the final prediction head and variable coding modules
need retraining. This model has undergone testing for several downstream tasks, including global and
regional forecasting and prediction for unseen climate tasks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Pangu Weather is a transformer architecture trained on three dimensional weather variables, as opposed to Climax, where all data was two dimensional. The lead time
is also handled differently, with the model being trained to predict the weather at a certain time in
the future, as opposed to the approach taken in the ClimaX work, where the lead time is passed as
a parameter during the training phase. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/pangu2.png" alt="PanguWeather Architecture" /></p>
<p>The former approach is more similar to the one used in this
project, where the simplicity of the dataset allows for a more straightforward implementation of the
lead time, sacrificing some flexibility in the process. Finally, the Pangu weather model features some
advanced techniques which separate it from all other competitors, namely the use of two different
resolutions for the encoding of each variable, allowing the model to capture both large scale and small
scale features, and use the attention mechanism to focus on different parts of the input data at the
same time. </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/pangu1.png" alt="PanguWeather Architecture" /></p>
<p>To achieve these two resolution, an encoder-decoder approach is used, where the encoder
is tasked with the downscaling of input variables, and the decoder is tasked with the upscaling of the
output. All transformer blocks are then applied to the output of the encoder, taking as input both
the low and high resolution information.</p>

<p>FuXi is an auto-regressive model for weather forecasting. The model is
based on the U-transformer architecture, and is able to recurrently produce a prediction for the next
timestep, given the previous predictions. </p>
<p><img src="../imgs/fuxi1.png" alt="FuXi" /></p>
<p>To generate a 15 days forecast, it is estimated it takes the
model around 60 iterations, with a lead time of 6 hours. The loss utilized is multi-step, meaning it
takes into account several timesteps at once, minimizing the error for each of them. This is in contrast
with the approach taken in this project, where the loss is computed for each timestep individually. The
U-transformer takes as input around 70 variables, for the current timestep, as well as the the preceding
frame. All the variables used for this model are however restricted to two dimensions, ignoring any
height layer. This architecture is a variation of the vanilla transformer model, and as opposed to the
latter, before passing the encoded information to the self attention blocks, it downscales partially the
input.</p>

<p>The exponential term in the equation drives the system‚Äôs first part (exponentially fast) to 0 and the entire hidden state to A. This issue becomes more apparent when there are recurrent connections and causes vanishing gradient factors when trained by gradient descent. </p>

<p><strong>Continuous time/depth neural networks</strong> (CTRNNs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) where the nodes (neurons) are described by differential equations.</p>
<p>\( \frac{dx(t)}{dx} = f_{n,k,l}(x(t), I(t), \theta) \)</p>
<p>Where f is the neural network, x is the state of the neuron, I is the input and \(\theta\) are the parameters of the network.</p>
<p>The state of the network is the state of all the neurons in the network.</p>
<p>There is no computation for each time step, the network is updated arbitrairly, unlike RNNs.</p>
<p>\( \frac{dx(t)}{dx} = -\frac{x(t)}{\tau} + f_{n,k,l}(x(t), I(t), \theta) \)</p>
<h2 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>We need a numerical ODE solver, to resolve the differential equations.</p>
<p>The backward pass can either be done with the adjoint sensitivity method (loss + neural ODE solver + adjoint state) or with the backpropagation through time method (classic).
The latter method is considered better as it is not a black box. </p>

<p>The network might associate the dynamics of the task with its own behaviour (ex. steering left/right implies camera movement).</p>
<p>The liquid time-constant (LTC) model is based on neurons in the form of differential equations interconnected via sigmoidal synapses.</p>
<p>Because LTCs are ordinary differential equations, their behavior can only be described over time. LTCs are universal approximators and implement causal dynamical models. However, the LTC model has one major disadvantage: to compute their output, we need a numerical differential equation-solver which seriously slows down their training and inference time. </p>
<h2 id="expressivity"><a class="header" href="#expressivity">Expressivity</a></h2>
<p>Using the trajectory length method it is possible to measure the expressivity of a network.

<p>These networks tend to have a higher expressivity than RNNs, but are bad with long term dependencies. </p>
<p>Differential equations can form causal structures, which is good. </p>
<p>Some limitations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>the complexity of this network is tied to the ODE solver, which use fixed steps. Some solutions include Hypersolvers, closed form solutions and sparse flows.</li>

<p>Graphcast is a graph neural network architecture with an encoder-decoder
configuration. The graph neural network is used to encode unstructured input data into a graph
representation. As opposed to, for instance, convolutional layers where neighbouring information
is encoded in a structured grid, graph layers use message passing between nodes to capture the
relationships between different parts of the input data. This allows for the encoding of different kind
of information, not necessarily restricted to a grid configuration.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/graphcast2.png" alt="GraphCast" /></p>
<p>One important hyperparamter to be set in this kind of architectures is the number of hops the
messages containing neighbouring information are allowed to travel. This is crucial for the model to
learn from the correct amount of knowledge, and allows for reducing the computational complexity of
the model, as the number of hops is directly related to the time required for the model to train.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-12"><a class="header" href="#introduction-12">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The concept of fast weight programmers (FWP) is introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258">this paper</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to use a <strong>slow network</strong> to program by gradient descent the weights of a <strong>fast network</strong>. FWP learn to pmanipulate the content of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. </p>
<p>Linear transformers have constant memory size and time complexity linear which depends on the sequence length. The time complexity is reduced thanks to the linearization of the self-attention layer and softmax operation.</p>
<h2 id="linear-transformers-as-fwp-1"><a class="header" href="#linear-transformers-as-fwp-1">Linear Transformers as FWP</a></h2>
<p>In normal neural networks, the weights are fixed and the input is manipulated, while the activation is input dependant and can change at inference time. 
The idea of FWP is also have the weights variable and input dependent (synaptic modulation). </p>
<ul>
<li>Context-dependent -&gt; slow weights</li>
<li>Context-independent -&gt; fast weights</li>
</ul>
<p>The process revolves around a slow network which is trained to program the weights of the fast network. This makes the fast weights dependent on 
the spatio-temporal context of the input stream.</p>
<p>Which instructions to use? Outer product: </p>
<p>\( a^{(i)}, b^{(i)} = W_ax^{(i)}, W_bx^{(i)} \)
\( W^{(i)} = \sigma (W^{(i-1) + a^{(i)} \oplus b^{(i)}}) \)
\( y^{(i)} = W^{(i)} x^{(i)} \)</p>
<p>The outer product is \( \oplus \), \sigma is the activation function, W_a and W_b are the trainable slow weights, while W is the fast weight matrix.</p>
<h2 id="linearizing-self-attention"><a class="header" href="#linearizing-self-attention">Linearizing self-attention</a></h2>
<p>Instead of removing the softmax, prior works have introduced techniques for linearizing the softmax.
This improves the computational efficiency of the self-attention layer for long sequences. </p>
<p>An important term is the softmax kernel \( \kappa(k, q) = exp(k \dot q) \), which in linear self-attention is approximated by another kernel \( \kappa'(k, q) = \phi(k)^T \phi(q) \).</p>
<p>Since the embedding space for keys is limited, there is only room for d orthogonal vectors. If the length of the sequence is larger than d, th model might be in a overcapacity regime. In this case the model should dynamically interact with the memory content and determine which association to remember and which one to forget. 
On the other hand, the standard transformer stores associations as immutable pairs, increasing its memory requirements.</p>

<p>The training of large language models (LLMs) is compute intensive and requires large amounts of data.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-laws-of-transformers"><a class="header" href="#scaling-laws-of-transformers">Scaling Laws of Transformers</a></h2>
<p>The loss of LLMs scales with both the training data and model parameters. Consequently, it scales with the amount of computation.</p>
<p>The total number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is approximately, </p>
<p>\( T_{FLOPS} ‚àº 6 \times P \times D\)</p>
<p>where P and D are number of model parameters and tokens, respectively. </p>
<p>compared to the attention and other blocks, the feed forward block typically requires the most computation. 
For each element of a feed-forward weight matrix, there are a total of 6 FLOPs per input token. 
the computation hence scales quadratically with the model size.</p>
<p>For example, training a 175B parameter GPT3 model requires \(3.7√ó10^{24}\) FLOPs, and it quickly grows to \(1.2√ó10^{26}\) FLOPs for a 1T parameter GPT-style model.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-and-energy-projection"><a class="header" href="#runtime-and-energy-projection">Runtime and energy projection</a></h2>
<p>the runtime can be straightforwardly predicted via</p>
<p>\( t = T_{FLOPs}‚àïR_{FLOPs} \)
\( ‚àº 120 \times P^2‚àïR_{FLOPs}, \)</p>
<p>where \(T_{FLOPs}\) and \(R_{FLOPs}\) are the compute operations in FLOPs and training performance in FLOPS</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/eval_llms_com_1.png" alt="Eval" /></p>
<p>The energy consumption can be evaluated by: </p>
<p>\(E = t \times R_{ùöÜùöäùöùùöù}\)</p>
<p>where \(R_{ùöÜùöäùöùùöù}\) is the averaged power measured from few iterations.</p>
<p>For Summit and Crusher: the peak performance in half precision for the V100 (112 TFLOPS) and MI250X (384 TFLOPS) GPUs and linear scaling up to full system</p>
<h2 id="results-3"><a class="header" href="#results-3">Results</a></h2>
<p>The training performance for FSDP and DeepSpeed-Megatron is 62.1 and 65.1 TFLOPS, respectively. From this baseline, the performance drops 20% and 44% for DeepSpeed-Megatron when using tensor parallelism within a NUMA domain and a node on Summit, respectively. The impact for FSDP is less (30% within a node compared to 44% for DeepSpeed-Megatron) due to less frequent communication and a smaller total message size. </p>
<h4 id="scaling-analysis"><a class="header" href="#scaling-analysis">Scaling analysis</a></h4>
<p>We scale up the LLMs training on both Summit and Crusher: </p>
<p><img src="./imgs/eval_llms_com_2.png" alt="Eval" /></p>
<p>The scaling efficiency is about 97%, signaling Frontier can be a promising platform for training LLMs of these model sizes</p>
<h4 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy consumption</a></h4>
<p>To estimate the energy usage, we trace the GPU power in watts during the training for FSDP training of GPT 175B model on Summit and Crusher. 
One batch step takes 359 and 301 s, correspondingly. </p>
<p>The averaged power usage is about 85 and 408 Watts, for Summit and Crusher, respectively, and the corresponding computational efficiency is 0.165 and 0.235 TFLOPS/Watt.</p>
<p>As Crusher system bears the same architecture as the first Exascale system Frontier and their unprecedented mix-precision capability, we believe they are well-suited as the platform for training LLMs at extreme scale.</p>

<p>One caveat to consider in our estimation is that the analysis is based on the current implementations of GPT-NeoX (DeepSpeed-Megatron) and PyTorch (FSDP). It‚Äôs important to note that the field is rapidly evolving, with ongoing advancements that can further reduce communication costs.</p>

<p>For theoretical peak and achievable performance, the minimum per-device communication bandwidth needed is 37 and 94 GB/s, respectively.
The current 25 GB/s per-device on Crusher is not sufficient to support linear scaling for training GPT 1T model. </p>

It also obeys the power law L. </p>
<p>\( B_{crit}(L) = \frac{B_*}{L^{\frac{1}{\alpha_B}}} \)</p>
<p>where \(B_* \approx 2^{8}\) and \(\alpha_B \approx 0.21 \).</p>
<p>Critical Batch size follows the same scaling laws as performance increases. It needs to be increased by a factor of 2 for every 13% decrease in loss. In the same way, it is indipendent of network depth and width and model size.</p>
<p>\( B_{crit}(L) = E_{min} / S_{min} \)</p>
<p>where \(E_{min}\) is the minimum amount of samples needed to be processed and  \(S_{min}\) is the minimum amount of steps needed to reach the L. </p>
<h2 id="early-stopping"><a class="header" href="#early-stopping">Early Stopping</a></h2>
<p>Overfitting is proportional to the correction from ending training at \( S_{stop} \), where \( S_{min} \approx S_{stop} \). Also this needs to be an under-estimation, as test loss decreases slower than training loss.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-deep-learning"><a class="header" href="#distributed-deep-learning">Distributed deep learning</a></h2>
<p>Distributed training is the process of subdividing the training workload of, for example, a large neural
network across multiple processors. These processors are often referred to as workers, and they are
tasked to compute in parallel to speed up the training process. There are two approaches to parallelism:
data and model. In data parallelism, the full training set is divided between all the workers, where a
copy of the model is also kept. Training is done either synchronously, where all the workers wait for
each other, synchronize the gradients, and only then perform the backward step; or asynchronously,
where a selected worker is tasked with keeping an updated version of the weights, and all the others
can read and write from this worker, often called a ‚Äùparameter server‚Äù. Using the latter procedure
means that all resources are used at the same time, without any delay. However, it also means that
only one worker at a time is training with the latest version of the weights. In large clusters the
centralized nature of this approach can also create bottlenecks. Model parallelism, on the other hand,
divides the model either horizontally, i.e. node-wise, or vertically, i.e. layer-wise, between several
workers who are allowed to run at the same time. This approach also reduces the footprint of the
model in each worker, making it lighter on the GPU‚Äôs memory.</p>
<h3 id="ddp"><a class="header" href="#ddp">DDP</a></h3>
<p>Distributed Data Parallel is a method of data parallelism that enables a program to operate on
numerous machines simultaneously. Applications utilizing DDP generate numerous processes and
initialize one DDP instance for each process. </p>
<h3 id="fsdp"><a class="header" href="#fsdp">FSDP</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, it may not be possible to create a duplicate of the model for every process. In
these instances, Fully Sharded Data Parallel may be utilized, where the optimiser states, gradients,
and parameters of the model are subdivided across all DDP ranks. In this case, the neural network is
divided into smaller sub-models, each of which represents a portion of the parameters of the overall
model. This approach allows different parts of the model to be processed simultaneously by different
processing units, and can be used in conjunction with a data-parallel approach that splits the training
set to achieve even faster processing times. This results in a program that has less impact on GPU
memory, thus reducing execution times.</p>
<h3 id="deepspeed"><a class="header" href="#deepspeed">DeepSpeed</a></h3>
<p><strong>DeepSpeed</strong> is a deep learning optimisation suite that enables efficient scalability and faster
execution times for both training and inference of large machine learning models. It was developed
by Microsoft and claims to offer a 15x speedup over other state-of-the-art parallelization techniques.
It provides memory efficient data parallelism and enables training without model parallelism through
a novel solution called Zero Redundancy Optimizer. Unlike basic data parallelism, where memory
states are replicated across data-parallel processes, ZeRO partitions model states and gradients to save
significant memory. Several other memory optimisation techniques are also used, such as Constant
Buffer Optimisation, which combines all communication-based operations into a single operand, and
Contiguous Memory Optimisation, which reduces fragmentation during training.</p>

<h2 id="physics"><a class="header" href="#physics">Physics</a></h2>
<p>A tropical cyclone is a storm system that rotates rapidly, featuring a low-pressure center, intense
winds, and an organized series of thunderstorms that cause intense rain and sudden gusts.
The term tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively
over tropical seas, while cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle, around a central eye, with
surface winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern
one.
These cyclones have a diameter most often found
between 100 and 2,000 km. The powerful swirling winds of a tropical cyclone, as the ones shown
in Figure 2.3, arise due to the Earth‚Äôs rotation imparting angular momentum as air moves towards
the axis of rotation. These storms are generally most severe when over or near water and quickly
lose intensity when moving over land. Damage can result from strong winds, rain, high waves, and
storm surges, all of which are phenomena of rising water caused by high-speed winds pushing water
towards the coast.</p>
<p>These tropical storms are low-pressure regions in the troposphere. The pressure is the lowest
near the surface, while at the center of these storms sea level pressures are among the lowest ever
observed. These systems are called ‚Äùwarm core‚Äù because the environment near their center is warmer
than the ambient temperature at all heights.
At the periphery of the storm, the air may be nearly calm; however, because of the Earth‚Äôs rotation, the air
possesses non-zero absolute angular momentum. As the air flows radially inwards, it starts rotating
cyclonically so as to conserve angular momentum effectively. At a certain distance from the centre of the storm,
air starts moving upwards towards the top of the troposphere.
The air, once lifted, moves away from the storm‚Äôs centre and forms
a layer of high clouds called ‚Äùcirrus clouds‚Äù. These processes ultimately create a wind field that is
almost symmetrical around the storm‚Äôs centre. Wind speeds are low at the centre, increase moving
outwards towards the radius of maximum winds and then decay more gradually with radius.</p>

<h2 id="incremental-probability-in-cyclone-prediction"><a class="header" href="#incremental-probability-in-cyclone-prediction">Incremental Probability in Cyclone Prediction</a></h2>
<p>One possible improvement to the presented work arises from the fact that the dataset currently illustrates the likelihood of a cyclone being present in a patch with a simple Gaussian distribution. Nonetheless, as the weather variables increasingly make it more plausible, the probability of a cyclone should raise over time. It may be possible to encode this behaviour by manipulating the standard deviation parameter of the Gaussian, resulting in the probability area progressively expanding over time. This would require determining when a patch is displaying indications of forming a tropical cyclone and identifying the exact central position in the patch.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-oriented-training"><a class="header" href="#parameter-oriented-training">Parameter oriented training</a></h2>
<p>One of the main differences between the current implementation of the model and the one presented in the ClimaX paper, is the fact that the latter is trained to predict the input variables shifted by a certain amount of lead time, and the training is repeated for several lead times. This allows the architecture to learn the correct behaviour of each variable over time, and enhances its flexibility by allowing at inference time to take a lead time parameter, and output the correct prediction. This approach has been referenced to as ‚Äùparameter oriented training‚Äù, and by its very flexible nature allows for a more general purpose model, which can be used for several different tasks.</p>
<h2 id="global-forecasting-system"><a class="header" href="#global-forecasting-system">Global forecasting system</a></h2>
<p>In a similar way to ClimaX‚Äôs approach, it may be feasible to merge the image patches and generate a worldwide weather forecast. This would not necessitate any modifications to the current model since the global image normalization is already executed. Additionally, the dataset can be adjusted to share an N-pixel border with adjoining patches and prevent loss of nearby data.
This modification addresses weather variable forecasting and has no impact on this project‚Äôs fine- tuning section. Predicting global cyclones may not be necessary since the regions where they most often form are widely recognized, and a regional forecasting approach would be enough.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-transformers"><a class="header" href="#time-series-transformers">Time-Series Transformers</a></h2>
<p>Among several advantages of the transformer architecture, the ability to capture long-range depen- dencies and interactions is particularly central to time series modeling.
A possible improvement to the current work could revolve around increasing the dimensionality of the input data by adding a temporal dimension, and using this information to better predict the future weather. This would imply passing a sequence of time snapshots to the model, and the tensor‚Äôs dimensions would become &lt;B, T, V, H, Lat, Lon&gt;, where T is the number of time snapshots.</p>
<p>As for the modifications necessary to the current architecture, the positional encoding of the transformer has to be changed, to allow for the correct encoding of the temporal dimension. What has been done in similar works, is allow for the embedding to be learned from time series data, and not be fixed as in the current work. A similar approach is to use the timestamp information to influence the training of these embedding layers, and allow for a more accurate representation of the data.</p>

<h2 id="connection-to-the-intertwin-project"><a class="header" href="#connection-to-the-intertwin-project">Connection to the Intertwin project</a></h2>
<p>One possible mean of unifying the two works could revolve around the use of graph neural network architectures, and integrating these mostly novel approaches into large foundation models. While Fronza‚Äôs work revolved around graph neural networks, there exist in the literature examples of applications of these kind of models to global weather forecasting, which is an essential requirement for developing a foundation model based on GNNs. These techniques have already been tested in the literature, where Graph Transformers are used to generate text, processing both the data with the classical approach, but also building a knowledge graph of the sentence, enhancing the understanding of the context. This approach could be used to build a foundation model which is able to understand the context of the input data, and use this knowledge to improve the prediction ability of the model. In this case, the context could be the current regional weather, and the model could use this information to better predict the future weather</p>
